## Overview of the Code
Run the `readXMLSTDP.m` before running any other analysis code.

The code consists of the following MATLAB scripts:

- `readXMLSTDP.m` : Reads the xml generated by the simulator. The name of the file is hardcoded. Reads the source neuron index, destination neuron index and weights of the synapses, and a directed graph 'G' and an undirected graph 'GUndirected' is the result of this code. 
- `generateAdjacencyMatrix.m`:  Normalizes the weights by adding minimum value greater than zero to the weights for better visulization and generates an adjacency matrix for the graph and 
- `calculateCentralityValues.m`: Calculates centrality values and generates scatter and histogram plots for each of them. Run each plot code one at a time as this code can't generate multiple images at a time (there might be a way to do this in MATLAB that I haven't figured it out )
- `hist_minDistfromBorder_centrality.m`: generates histograms for minimum distance from the border of the network
